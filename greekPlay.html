    <h3>THE PERSONS</h3>

    <p class="lftbrk">SCENE. A desert shore of the Island of Lemnos.</p>
    <h6>OD.</h6>
        <p>Where? let me see it. Above there, or below?</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
        Yonder, above. And yet I hear no tread.<br>
        </p>
        <p span class="direction">
            <span class="cnm">[NEOPTOLEMUS</span> climbs up to the
            cave]</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
        Look if he be not lodged in slumber there.</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
        I find no inmate, but an empty room.</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
        What? no provision for a dwelling-place?</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
        A bed of leaves for some one harbouring here.</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
        Nought else beneath the roof? Is all forlorn?</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
        A cup of wood, some untaught craftsmanâ€™s skill,<br>
        And, close at hand, these embers of a fire.</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
        That store is his. I read the token clear.</p>w
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
        Oh! and these festering rags give evidence,<br>
        Steeped as with dressing some malignant sore.</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
        The man inhabits here: I know it now.<br>

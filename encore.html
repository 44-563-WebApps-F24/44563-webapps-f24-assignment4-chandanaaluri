           <p> My man is going, and shall watch the path.
            What more dost thou require of me? Speak on.</p>

            <h6 class="OD">OD.</h6>
          <p> Son of Achilles, know that thou art come 
            To serve us nobly, not with strength alone,<br>
            But, faithful to thy mission, if so be,<br>
            To do things strange, unwonted to thine ear.</p>

            <h6 class="NEO">NEO.</h6>
           <p> What dost thou bid me?</p>

            <h6 class="OD">OD.</h6>
           <p> To entrap the mind of Poeas’ son with words.<br>
            When he shall ask thee, who and whence thou art,<br>
            Declare thy name and father. ’Tis not that<br>
            I charge thee to conceal. But for thy voyage,<br>
            ’Tis homeward, leaving the Achaean host,<br>
            With perfect hatred hating them, because<br>
            They who had drawn thee with strong prayers from home,<br>
            Their hope for taking Troy, allowed thee not<br>
            Thy just demand to have thy father’s arms,<br>
            But, e’er thy coming, wrongly gave them o’er<br>
            Unto Odysseus: and thereon launch forth<br>
            With boundless execration against me.<br>
            That will not pain me, but if thou reject<br>
            This counsel, thou wilt trouble all our host,<br>
            Since, if his bow shall not be ta’en, thy life<br>
            Will ne’er be crowned through Troy’s discomfiture.<br>
            </p>
